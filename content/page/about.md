###
This repository provides researchers with structured access to a wealth of metadata, specifically from eye tracking, neuroimaging (EEG, fMRI), and human sensing (EDA, cardiovascular activity, skin temperature) datasets collected during geospatial tasks in-lab, virtual environment or real-world scenarios. By offering detailed metadata across key dimensions like participant characteristics, experimental design, stimuli, and analysis methods, we aim to facilitate data discovery, reuse, and comparative analysis. We link directly to open datasets shared on platforms such as Zenodo, Harvard Dataverse, figshare promoting accessibility and transparency.

### Our Team:
This repository is the result of a collaborative effort by researchers with diverse expertise in cartography, spatial cognition, human-computer interaction, and open science. Our team members include:

#### Merve Keskin (DSc. PhD. Geomatics Engineer): 
An expert in cartography, spatial cognition, human sensing (EDA), and multimodal user experiments (eye tracking, EEG). Merve's research focuses on understanding human spatial behavior using wearable sensors and open geospatial data. She is passionate about integrating new technologies with geoinformatics to advance map usability research. She is currently co-chair of the ICA Commission on User Experience, and mentor/mentee in the Next Generation Cartographers initiative.
