#### Abstract
[This study investigates how expert and novice map users’ attention is influenced by the map design characteristics of 2D web maps by building and sharing a framework to analyze large volumes of eye tracking data. In this context, we developed an automated area-of-interest (AOI) analysis framework to evaluate participants’ fixation durations, and to assess the influence of linear and polygonal map features on spatial memory. The dataset entitled CartoGAZE is publicly available.](https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/12/1/21)
