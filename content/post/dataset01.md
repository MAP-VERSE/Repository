#### Abstract
[A geospatial image-based eye movement dataset called GeoEye, a publicly shared, widely available eye movement dataset. This dataset consists of 110 college- aged participants who freely viewed 500 images, including thematic maps, remote sensing images, and street view images, which could use for geospatial image saliency prediction and map user identification.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15230406.2022.2153172)
