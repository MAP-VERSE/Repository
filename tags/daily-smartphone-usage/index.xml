      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/13/2/42&#34;&gt;This study investigated the impact of smartphone usage frequency on the effectiveness and accuracy of symbol location in a variety of spatial contexts on mobile maps using eye-tracking technology while utilizing the example of Mapy.cz. The scanning speed and symbol detection were also considered. The use of mobile applications for navigation is discussed, emphasizing their popularity and convenience of use. The importance of eye tracking as a valuable tool for testing the usability of cartographic products, enabling the assessment of users’ visual strategies and their ability to memorize information, was highlighted. The frequency of smartphone use has been shown to be an important factor in users’ ability to locate symbols in different spatial contexts. Everyday smartphone users have shown higher accuracy and efficiency in image processing, suggesting a potential link between habitual smartphone use and increased efficiency in mapping tasks. Participants who were dissatisfied with the legibility of a map looked longer at the symbols, suggesting that they put extra cognitive effort into decoding the symbols. In the present study, gender differences in pupil size were also observed during the study. Women consistently showed a larger pupil diameter, potentially indicating greater cognitive load on the participants.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;link rel=&#34;stylesheet&#34; href=&#34;https://Freshorange2.github.io/Open-Metadata-Platform-for-Map-Usability_v2/css/hugo-easy-gallery.css&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;gallery caption-position-bottom caption-effect-fade hover-effect-zoom hover-transition&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ImageGallery&#34;&gt;&#xA;&#x9;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;</description>
