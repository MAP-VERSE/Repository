# MAP-VERSE: MAP Usability - Validated Empirical Research by Systematic Evaluation 🚀

🌍 **Website:** [MAP-VERSE Repository](https://map-verse.github.io/Repository/)

## 📌 Introduction
Welcome to **MAP-VERSE**! We are building a unique **data discovery repository** dedicated to advancing **empirical research in map usability and spatial cognition**.

Our goal is to foster **open science and collaboration** by creating a **centralized, queryable repository** for metadata from **open-access map usability studies**. This collection includes **publicly shared datasets** recorded during **geospatial tasks**, such as **map reading and navigation**.

## 🌟 Our Mission
By developing this repository, we strive to:

✔ **Encourage standardized reporting of user studies** (minimum reporting standards)  
✔ **Showcase best practices in map reading studies**  
✔ **Increase generalizability and reproducibility of findings**  

## 📊 What’s Inside?
This repository serves as a **queryable metadata repository** for **open-access datasets** related to:

🔹 **Eye Tracking** 👀  
🔹 **Neuroimaging (EEG, fMRI)** 🧠  
🔹 **Human Sensing (EDA, cardiovascular activity, skin temperature)** ❤️‍🔥  

All datasets are recorded during **geospatial tasks** (a.k.a. map reading user studies), and the repository links to open datasets shared elsewhere (e.g., **Zenodo, Harvard Dataverse**).

## 📂 Explore & Contribute
We welcome contributions! If you're interested in **map usability research**, **spatial cognition**, or **human sensing studies**, feel free to explore and collaborate.

📩 For inquiries, contact us or submit an issue on GitHub.  
🚀 Let's advance open science together!
